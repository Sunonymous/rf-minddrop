# minddrop

A re-frame application designed to assist the organization of your mind.

## Overview

Minddrop is an application to keep your mind organized. It is an organizer of process, rather than information.

Our minds connect with an incredible amount of ideas and inspirations and it can be challenging to navigate them in an efficient or effective way. That is what Minddrop is designed to assist with.

The name Minddrop has two meanings behind it. The first comes from the idea of the mind as a fluid medium, akin to a cloud of water. The application will *drop* your ideas in front of you one by one, just as a pipette drops liquids. The application is intended to allow you to *drop* the effort of keeping track of your interests and actions. So go aheadâ€”[drop your mind](https://dropyourmind.com/).

## Manifesto
### Respect the Limits of Attention
  Shows things to you one at a time. Skip as frequently as you would like.
### Flow with You
  The things you interact with more often will be presented to you first. This helps you continually engage with what matters most to you in the moment.
### Nothing Lost
  Minddrop ensures you see every drop in a particular source at least once before it begins again.
### Ease of Navigation
  Because not everything in your mind is immediately apparent at any given moment, Minddrop does it best to show you what you're looking for. You may browse through your drops via its built-in queueing system, or search them by name. A linking system will be implemented to facilitate categorization.
### Remain Agnostic to Time
  The data that you've provided to Minddrop only changes when you change it. Nothing is done without your confirmation.
### Respect Privacy
  Your data is yours and only yours, always. Minddrop can be used completely offline. This means while you are never exposed, you must manage it responsibly.
### Organizational Freedom
  You have your own unique way of thought, and Minddrop should allow you to organize your mind how you see fit.
